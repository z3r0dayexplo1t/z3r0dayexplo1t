# 👋 Hey there, I'm Sam/Z3r0dayexplo1t

I'm a 20-year-old developer obsessed with building secure, scalable, and slightly overengineered systems. I thrive in the deep backend — think bare metal performance, behavioral intelligence, and smart automation.

### 🚀 What I'm Into
- Web security (especially the behavioral side)
- High-performance APIs and backend infra
- Privacy-first systems that *just work*

### 🧠 Interests
- Bot detection & anti-automation strategies
- Reverse engineering browser behavior
- Real-time data pipelines & WebSocket madness
- Engineering clean, intelligent developer tools

### 🧰 Stack In Rotation
`Go` • `Node.js` • `TypeScript` • `Redis` • `MongoDB` • `PostgreSQL` • `WebSockets`

### 💻 Side Projects (that make my commit chart glow)
- Sensor-based interaction systems  
- Developer-first tools with a focus on speed, clarity & control  
- Experimental protocol designs for secure communication
